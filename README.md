# Tennis (paper game)

Tennis is an (abstract) strategic pencil and paper game for two players. The game field consists of 4 fields and a centre line. These are called (-2,-1,0,1,2), with negative numbers belonging to player 1, positive to player 2. At start, the ball is at the centre line (0).

Both players start with the same initial number (e.g. 50 points). In each draw, both players choose a number, and the ball is moved towards the player with the smallest number. The number chosen reduces the points for the next draws. The aim of the game is to move the ball beyond the second field of the opponent. The game is described in Das gro√üe Buch der Block- und Bleistiftspiele.

I implement the game in bash script.
Running examples and more details about the game can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_(paper_game)).
